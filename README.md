HOA PRO
============

Best experience is in Visual Studio 2012. Ensure you have .NET Framework 4.5 and SQL Server Compact 4.0 installed.
Load HOAPro.sln and it should load the single project HOAPro.csproj. Build and run.

During debug running note that you may need to physically copy the HOAPro.sdf file into a bin/Debug/Persistence folder.
